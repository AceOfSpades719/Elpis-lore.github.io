<h3>Peephole Interrogation</h3>

  Hah... Hah.... Please, let me stay! I can't go back. I just can't. Please, I'm scared... I feel it crawling down my spine. I knew this was coming. Now I can't help but fear the worst always.

      Uh, well, my house. You know, err, you see, visitors broke in.
<br>
I ran, and a For Rest delivery driver brought me here.
<br>
I'm sorry, but I need shelter. I'm terrified.

      No. My mother is gone, and I was staying in my grandmother's house. <br>
 She's also gone.
<br>
My other relatives are in, well, America. I don't think anywhere else will take me.

      Sorry! That probably sounded insane.
<br>
I... I'm considered such.
<br>
I'm anxious, paranoid, worse. I feared the apocalypse. I had horrible thoughts that it might happen at any second.
<br>
You see here? It's my supplies. I'll give you any of it. Even my pills if you just save me.

      I have plenty of supplies in my backpack!
<br>
I am a doomsday packer. I was constantly scared of some sort of apocalypse. Something that would bring us despair.
<br>
Uh, it happened. I'll give you water, canned food, why, you can even have some of my pills! Just a few.

      I'm sorry. It's just... I'm paranoid and very anxious. Sick, too.

Please don't make me leave because of that.

I just... Ugh, I'm so anxious that I might throw up. I don't want to die. Please... Won't you save me?
